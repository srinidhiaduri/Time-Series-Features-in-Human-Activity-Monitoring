# Time-Series-Features-in-Human-Activity-Monitoring

The objective of this project is to extract time series features for human activity
monitoring.
The dataset contains human activity data for 15 subjects. For this project we will consider consider accelerometer data for all the 15
subjects for walking, running, climbing up and climbing down.

These are the tasks applied to the dataset:
1. Apply natural visibility graph (NVG) and horizontal visibility graph (HVG) to the
aforementioned data
2. Compute average degree, network diameter, and average path length
3. For the above computations select sample size of 1024 data points ( from 1000
to 2024) for each of the 15 time series
4. Tabulate all the results
5. Generate  scatter plots: average degree vs network diameter and color the points
according to walking and running (do this for each accelerometer signal and
each method (HVH and NVG))
6. Generate  scatter plots: average degree vs network diameter and color the points
according to climbing up and climbing down (do this for each accelerometer
signal and each method (HVH and NVG))
